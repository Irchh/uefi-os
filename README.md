# uefi-os
My (Soonâ„¢) UEFI os written in C. Very hacky and I'm mostly done with this now. Only making it public because I don't plan on doing anything with it.

# Features after exiting UEFI Boot Services
- Rendering
	- PSF1/2 font rendering
- Can read keyboard input (So could write simple shell)
- Write syscall (Only to screen atm, aka can use it for output)
- That's it really so far

# Wanted features (Not happening in this project, maybe next one)
- I/O support (Keyboard/Mouse/Storage/etc.)
- Running programs
- Threading
- Multicore support
- At least partial Linux syscall support :)

# Why?
To learn! I love computers and want to learn about every inch
of how the inner workings work. I understand that this is a huge
undertaking, but thats also why I feel like I can learn so much from it.

First project after finishing highschool.
