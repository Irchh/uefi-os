# uefi-os
My (Soonâ„¢) UEFI os written in C.

# Features after exiting UEFI Boot Services
- Rendering
	- PSF1/2 font rendering
- Thats it really so far

# Wanted features
- I/O support (Keyboard/Mouse/Storage/etc.)
- Running programs
- Threading
- Multicore support
- At least partial Linux syscall support :)

# Why?
To learn! I love computers and want to learn about every inch
of how the inner workings work. I understand that this is a huge
undertaking, but thats also why I can learn so much from it.
